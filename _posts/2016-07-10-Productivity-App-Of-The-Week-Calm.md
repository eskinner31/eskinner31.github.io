#Productivity App of the Week: Calm™

###The Problem

Have you ever tried to get started with meditation and failed miserably? If you're like me the answer is a giant YES, and you've failed on multiple occasions. I've
always found it a bit difficult to started with meditation, because I never really knew if I was doing it right, and I never understood how much time to devote to really
getting deep in the zone. Luckily, some great team knew that there were a bunch of us groping around in the dark, and decided to create Calm™

###The Benefits

Within the first week of starting the app, after completing the first four intro sessions, I could pick up on a noticeably difference in my mood and focus heading into work.
I decided to start the training in the morning, in order to help get my mind geared for the workday, and to shake off whatever pre-work jitters I may have had (Noob Developer Syndrome).
After about 2 - 3 weeks of working with the app, I've noticed that I have become more patient with different challenges I have run into; whether they be with coding or finances.
I have also noticed that I have become less reactive when handling situations, that would typically be emotionally draining, and emotionally intense. I have also found that introspection
is at an all time high. What I mean by that, is my internal dialogue has improved and become more focused, and I have also been able to stop defeatist thoughts when they begin to form.
I honestly cannot say enough about the benefits I have noticed from meditating.

###Getting Started

Calm™ does an excellent job leading you through your first week of meditation. They have a 7 day intro session, that sits you down for 10 minutes and brings you
through a guided meditation. It's literally that simple. For those of you who like to track stats and challenge yourself, they have a streak counter, so you can work
on maintaining a streak as you meditate. What's really cool, is that they have a web app, and a mobile app so wherever you are, and whenever you feel as though you might
have some private time, you can get in your meditation for the day. It's really that simple.

If you'd like to get started, I would suggest that you head over to the App Store, Or the Play Store and download the app. Or, head over to the [Calm](www.calm.com)™ homepage
and get started.

Unfortunately, I have yet to decide whether or not I will pay money for the host of other guided meditation's they have. I have played with the idea before, and it's honestly
not that expensive. However, I'm content with utilizing the free timed meditation at the moment. If you happen to try the paid version of the app, feel free to email me your review at,

Happy Meditating!
