#Knex Basics

If you're new to coding in Javascript and working with Postgres then this post is for you. Knex is a simple query builder that helps you quickly set up and manager your SQL database all in Javascript. Set up migrations, seed data, and build queries all with the help of this little library.

If you're interested in getting started, I've linked a simple tutorial constructed by [Akyuna Akish](https://github.com/AkyunaAkish). He's a resident instructor working for Galvanize in the Colorado area and a killer developer. In this tutorial you will learn how to install Knex, and get it up and running in an express application. Akyuna was also gracious enough to provide a working app in the repo for you to install and test out if you're interested. Hope this makes working with Postgres a little bit easier in your life!
