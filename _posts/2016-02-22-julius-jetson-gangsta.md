# Gangsta

Julius Jetson, A D.C. DJ/Producer has been turning up the heat recently. He has been on a wicked rampage of releasing new tracks into the world. Definitely one to watch.

Check out his new mix 'Gangsta' and give it a favorite and a share if you dig it. But more importantly keep your eyes and ears open for things to come from this artist. The man is going places.
